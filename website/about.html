          <h2>About Reverb Junction</h2>
          <p>
            Offically founded in 1985, two somebodies back in 1979 decided to make Reverb Junction by buying out an old building for a couple bags of peanuts... well, compared to what real estate goes for nowadays. They chose a soon-to-be-genetrified part of their city, a decision that worked out lucratively in their future.
             Anyway, their determination (by corporate sabotage, bribery in monetary, narcotics, perverse sexual favours towards celebrity artists. Instances of threats of assault towards rival venue owners/employees and threats of committing property damage to their establishments,etc.) to stay in the popular music venue scene.They achieved capitalistic greatness by becoming the only venue
            where everyone wanted to be and blah blah blah. But they really found their mark by hiring a master cuilnary chef to reinvent bar/street food that brought music and food lovers together in some elitist congregation where they can smell each other chili dog farts and be smug about it.
            Now its the popular, wildly expensive establishment due to limited space thus having a waiting list yadda yadda yadda
            alot of very rich people go there thats all you need to know, so you're never gonna see the inside of this place
            so good-day and good-bye!
